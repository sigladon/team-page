I completed the  challenge with HTML and CSS only. This is the second challenge of DevChallenges I complete. I feel like now I have been able to write better code and get a pretty good result. I choose my favorite e-sport team to carry out the project. I took the team color scheme into consideration for the project. 


### Built With

I just used [HTML](https://github.com/sigladon/team-page/blob/master/index.html) and [CSS](https://github.com/sigladon/team-page/tree/master/css)
